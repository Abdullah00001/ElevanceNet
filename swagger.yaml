        This route accepts user input, validates the provided data, and checks whether the user's email is already registered. If the email is not already in use, a new user record is created in the database. Following successful registration, a one-time password (OTP) code is generated and sent to the user's email address for verification.

        This route verifies a user's account by accepting a One-Time Password (OTP) that was sent to their email during the signup process. Upon receiving a valid OTP, the system marks the user as verified, allowing them to access restricted features. If the OTP is incorrect, expired, or missing, an appropriate error response is returned. This ensures that only legitimate users can complete the registration process.

            The 200 status code indicates that the OTP has been successfully verified. This means the user's account has been marked as verified, granting them full access to all features and services that require verification. Additionally, an access token and refresh token are set in HTTP-only cookies, ensuring the user is authenticated without needing to log in again. At this stage, the user is considered fully registered and authenticated, and no further verification steps are required.

  # RESEND VERIFICATION CODE

    post:
      description: |-
        This endpoint allows unverified users to request a new verification email.  
        If a user has not received the original verification email or if the verification code has expired, they can use this route to resend the email.  
        Only unverified users can access this endpoint, and the frontend is responsible for preventing verified users from making this request.  
        A new verification email with a fresh code will be sent upon a successful request.

        This route is used for logging in a user by verifying their credentials (email and password). Upon receiving the correct email and password, the system authenticates the user. If authentication is successful, an access token and refresh token are generated and set in HTTP-only cookies. These tokens are used to maintain the user's session and authenticate further requests. The access token is used for immediate authentication, while the refresh token is used to obtain a new access token when it expires, ensuring a seamless and secure login experience.

            The 200 status code indicates that the login was successful. This means the user's email and password have been validated, and they are now authenticated. Upon successful login, the system generates an access token and a refresh token, which are set in HTTP-only cookies. The access token provides immediate authentication, while the refresh token allows the user to obtain a new access token when it expires. The user is now considered logged in and can access protected resources. No further login steps are required unless the session expires or the user logs out.
